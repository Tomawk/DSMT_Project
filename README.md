# HereThePaw Webapp (Distributed Systems project)

## Introduction

HereThePaw is a webapp designed to combat the problem of pet abandonment. It’s aimed at those
who can’t afford to take their pets to an overpriced pet boarding house and animal lovers who want
to make some money or just spend time with different animals. The application will allow users to
log in with two different roles. We will call pet sitters those users who wish to offer the service of
keeping animals for a period of time, and we will call pet owners those users who are looking for a
pet sitter to whom they can entrust their pet. After logging in, a pet owner has the opportunity
to make a reservation for a certain period for his pet to a pet sitter of his choice. The booking
must be accepted by the pet sitter to be considered effective. Both users can access the list of their
bookings, the pet sitter can of course accept or decline the booking for him. In order to decide
which pet sitter to book, a pet owner can read the reviews left by other users and see the average
rating. If he has already booked a service with that pet sitter, he can also leave a review.
HereThePaw also provides a chat room where pet owners and pet sitters can exchange information
about the exchange of the pet or subsequently inform each other about the progress of the stay.
